Research Interests
======
My research is mainly focused on development and analysis of efficient and structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations (a mesoscopic description of interacting particle systems with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example) and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation. 

Some of my recent representative work include:

* Fast Fourier spectral methods for Boltzmann type collisional kinetic equations
* Asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving schemes for multiscale kinetic equations
* Energy/entropy dissipative schemes for Fokker-Planck type equations
* Low rank methods for high dimensional kinetic equations
* Uncertainty quantification for kinetic equations
