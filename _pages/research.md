Research Interests
======
My research is mainly focused on the development and analysis of efficient and structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations (a mesoscopic description of interacting particle systems with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example) and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation. 

Some of my recent representative work includes:
* Fast spectral methods for Boltzmann type collisional kinetic equations
* Asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving schemes for multiscale hyperbolic and kinetic equations
* Energy/entropy dissipative schemes for Fokker-Planck type equations
* Low-rank methods for high dimensional kinetic equations
* Uncertainty quantification for kinetic equations
