Research Interests
======
My research primarily focuses on the development and analysis of efficient, structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations---a mesoscopic description of interacting particle systems, with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example---and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation. 

Some of my recent representative work includes:
* Fast spectral methods for Boltzmann-type collision operators
* Asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving schemes for multiscale hyperbolic and kinetic equations
* Energy/entropy-dissipative schemes for Fokker-Planck type equations
* Uncertainty quantification for kinetic equations
* Dynamical low-rank methods for high-dimensional kinetic equations
* Structure-preserving particle methods for kinetic equations
