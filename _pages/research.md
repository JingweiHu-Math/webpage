Research Interests
======
My research is primarily focused on the development and analysis of efficient and structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations -- a mesoscopic description of interacting particle systems with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example -- and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation. 

Some of my recent representative work includes:
* Fast spectral methods for Boltzmann type collisional kinetic equations
* Asymptotic-preserving and positivity-preserving schemes for multiscale hyperbolic and kinetic equations
* Energy/entropy dissipative schemes for Fokker-Planck type equations
* Dynamical low rank methods for high dimensional kinetic equations
* Uncertainty quantification for kinetic equations
