Research Interests
======
My research is mainly focused on development and analysis of efficient and structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations (a mesoscopic description of many-particle systems with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example) and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation.
