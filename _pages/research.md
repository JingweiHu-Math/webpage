Research Interests
======
My research is mainly focused on development and analysis of efficient and structure-preserving numerical methods for kinetic equations (a mesoscopic description of interacting particle systems with the nonlinear Boltzmann equation as a prominent example) and related problems arising in multiscale modeling and simulation. 

* Fast Fourier spectral method for the Boltzmann collision operator
*
